# Typenshow

Typenshow (Portmanteau for Type & Show) is a minimalistic Android app for quickly typing something down. \
NOT INTENDED for storing information (for now, it will be a feature in future), only for typing and showing the text for any purposes.

## FAQ

### What's on the roadmap of updates?

Here's the list:
1. Add Settings widget for changing fonts and their sizes
2. Add Theming for the Background and Text
3. Add storing of the written "snippets"

Randomize starting text (for fun, why not) 

### How compatible is the app for older phones?

Not much really. I just wanted to write this for my portfolio and as a personal tool, so the app works on \
my phone (Google Pixel 7 at least), due to the convenience of API level 30 (hot reloads, etc.) but if you want an app like this \
for yourself too or spread this for others, you can fork it or contribute here (if making it accessible for lower level APIs \ 
doesn't require a full re-write of the app i hope)

### How to contribute?

This is my first open-source project, so I don't know all the guidelines I should follow. \
Nevertheless, you can write to aerolibra1196@gmail.com for questions or open an Issue. \
