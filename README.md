# Typenshow

Typenshow (Portmanteau for Type & Show) is a minimalistic Android app for quickly typing something down. \
NOT INTENDED for storing information (although it will be a possibility in future), only for typing and showing the text for any purposes. \

## FAQ

### What state the app is in?

0.0.1 Alpha. Although the app is very niche, I (the maintainer) still want to add some features

### What's on the roadmap of updates?

Here's the list:
1. Add Settings widget for changing fonts and their sizes
2. Randomize starting text (for fun, why not)
3. Add Theming for the Background and Text

### How to contribute?

This is my first open-source project, so I don't know all the guidelines I should follow. \
Nevertheless, you can write to aerolibra1196@gmail.com for questions or open an Issue. \
